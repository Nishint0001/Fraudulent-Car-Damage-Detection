## About

This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for detecting fraudulent car damage insurance claims. The project's primary goal is to develop a robust and accurate model that can identify suspicious or fraudulent insurance claims associated with car physical damage.

**Key Features:**

- Comprehensive data preprocessing and visualization of car insurance claim data.
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Learning models.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- A user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction and quick fraud predictions.
- Detailed documentation and guides for users and contributors.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed.
- Git installed.
- (Optional) Virtual environment for a clean environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nishint0001/Fraudulent-Car-Damage-Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Fraudulent-Car-Damage-Detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the fraudulent car damage detection tool, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Fraudulent-Car-Damage-Detection
   ```

2. Run the CLI:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to load data, choose a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance. You can also use the CLI for real-time fraud predictions.

## Data

The project uses a carefully curated dataset of car insurance claims, which includes details of car damage and related information. The dataset is available for download [here](link-to-your-data).

## Data Preprocessing

Extensive data preprocessing is performed to clean and prepare the dataset for machine learning. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical attributes.

## Model Training

The project includes the training of various machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep learning models. Each model is trained and fine-tuned to achieve the best possible performance.

## Evaluation

The performance of each machine learning model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Detailed evaluation results are provided in the project's documentation.

## Results

The project has achieved remarkable results in detecting fraudulent car damage insurance claims. Visualizations and insights gained from the analysis are available in the [Results](results/) directory.
